# 🎬 Movie Management Platform

A web platform that allows users to upload, manage, and stream movies using a Django REST API backend. Video uploads are processed asynchronously (e.g., generating thumbnails) using Celery and Redis. The backend is fully containerized with Docker and secured using JWT authentication.
